;; A chef has collected data on the satisfaction level of his n dishes. Chef can cook any dish in 1 unit of time.
;; Like-time coefficient of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level i.e. time[i] * satisfaction[i].
;; Return the maximum sum of like-time coefficient that the chef can obtain after dishes preparation.
;; Dishes can be prepared in any order and the chef can discard some dishes to get this maximum value.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: satisfaction = [-1,-8,0,5,-9]
;; Output: 14
;; Explanation: After Removing the second and last dish, the maximum total like-time coefficient will be equal to (-1*1 + 0*2 + 5*3 = 14).
;; Each dish is prepared in one unit of time.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: satisfaction = [4,3,2]
;; Output: 20
;; Explanation: Dishes can be prepared in any order, (2*1 + 3*2 + 4*3 = 20)
;; Example 3:
;; Input: satisfaction = [-1,-4,-5]
;; Output: 0
;; Explanation: People do not like the dishes. No dish is prepared.
;; Constraints:
;; n == satisfaction.length
;; 1 <= n <= 500
;; -1000 <= satisfaction[i] <= 1000
